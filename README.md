This is a very WIP and likely unstable project.

## TODO

Includes, but is certainly not limited to:

- Refactor the code to make it neater and more maintainable.
  - Fix all the hacky P2P code
  - Add logging to make debugging P2P and other stuff easier
  - ...and much more (see `TODO` comments in code)
- Panning may perform poorly on certain devices and/or situations. Hopefully this does not entail the usage of `canvas` just to mitigate this.
- Make the sound design a little bit more complete (it was rushed lol).
